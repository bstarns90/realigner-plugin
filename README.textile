h1. Realigner Plugin

Source code of the intellij IDEA "Realigner plugin":http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/index?pr=&pluginId=7082
This is a plugin for the various intellij IDEs, working in IDEA, PhpStorm, AppCode, etc.



h2. Description

The Realigner plugin is helpful e.g. to quickly convert lines to comma separated lists and vice versa.
Additionally the plugin adds a tool to wrap a selection, the current line or each of multiple selected lines
with surrounding strings. The wrap tool of the plugin also provides options for escaping single, double quote
and backslash characters and to remove white-space lines from a multi-line selection.
The plugin settings allow for setting up configurations of quickly accessible preconfigured options,
available than in the wrap dialog.


Realigner adds the following editing tools:

* Ctrl+Shift+Alt+J - Joins selected lines by removing linefeeds. Optionally, a "gluing" string can be used as delimiter
* Ctrl+Shift+Alt+L - Splits current line or selection into multiple lines at, before or after an arbitrary delimiter
* Ctrl+Shift+Alt+W - Wraps current line / selection / each of multiple selected lines with an arbitrary prefix and/or postfix string
