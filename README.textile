h1. Realigner Plugin

Source code of the intellij IDEA "Realigner plugin":http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/index?pr=&pluginId=7082
This is a plugin for the various intellij IDEs, working in IDEA, PhpStorm, AppCode, etc.



h2. Description

The Realigner plugin adds three tools for reformatting text:
* Join (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+J) - Removes newlines from selected lines, optionally joining them using a "glue" string.
* Split (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+L)- Replaces arbitrary strings with newlines. Splitting with an empty delimiter and w/o selection inserts a newline at the soft-wrap boundary.
* Wrap / Unwrap (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+W) - Adds or removes a prefix- and postfix- string to a selection, the current line
or each of multiple selected lines. Frequently used wraps can be stored via the plugin settings.



Realigner is helpful e.g. for:
* Reformatting lines into comma-separated lists
* Converting lists into lines
* Breaking up long URLs for easier analysis
* Quickly commenting-out multiple lines of code even if that particular language is not supported
* Quickly un-commenting lines of code even if that particular language is not supported
* Commenting-out / un-commenting using keyboards with layouts not compliant to the keyboard shortcuts for the similar in-built function
* Reformatting long lines to wrap at the soft-wrap boundary (120 chars)
